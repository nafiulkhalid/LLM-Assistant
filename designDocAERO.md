**Document Overview:**  
→ Outlines design, architecture, tech stack, API structure, deployment strategy, and scalability considerations for AERO, an AI-powered voice assistant that executes tasks seamlessly.

**Commitment:**  
*AERO \- Always On, Always Ready*  
Effortless, Hands-Free Operation  
Efficiency at your command. Intelligence at your fingertips. This is AERO.

**Project Overview:**  
AERO is built to streamline digital workflow management by: 

1. Understanding natural language  
2. Executing commands instantly  
3. Automating complex tasks  
4. Seamlessly integrating with applications

AERO isn’t just another AI assistant—it’s an orchestrator of actions, built for speed, precision, and hands-free efficiency.

**Key Features:**

**Hackathon Goal:**

1. Build a **functional MVP** showcasing AERO’s **voice activation & automation**.  
2. Deploy the website & AI model to showcase capabilities.  
3. Gather early user interest via a waitlist signup.

**Future Expectations:** 

1. Expand multi-modal AI capabilities (Gemini Vision Integration).  
2. Add 11Labs voice synthesis for realistic responses.  
3. Improve app control (Zoom meeting auto-creation).  
4. Optimize cross-device synchronization for a seamless user experience.

**Project Structure:**  
AERO has two main repositories within TreeHacks25 GitHub Organization:

1. Website: The frontend for AERO, featuring a demo, waitlist signup, and product overview.  
2. Model V1.0: The core AI voice recognition and automation system.

→ The Python-based AI system will be deployed as an API service.  
The frontend will be a Next.js-based website, connected to the AI model. \[Initially we utilized JavaScript\]  
AERO’s executables will integrate directly with startup files for persistent background activation.
